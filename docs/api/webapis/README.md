# Web APIs

In this directory, we maintain the compatibility data for Web APIs that JSAR did implement that follows the format: https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data.

## Why use browser-compat-data

The browser-compat-data repository is a community-driven project that aims to provide up-to-date compatibility information for web technologies. It is used by the MDN Web Docs site, and can be used by other documentation projects to provide accurate and up-to-date information about web technologies.

Using browser-compat-data allows us to leverage the work of the MDN community, and to contribute back to the community by providing compatibility data for the APIs that JSAR did implement when most works are done.

## How to generate the documentation

To generate the documentation, you need to run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```
