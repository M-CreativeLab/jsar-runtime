# Introduction

JSAR ([/d í:-sar/](https://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=d%CA%92:-sar)) is a revolutionary browser engine library designed for the next computing era (Metaverse). It enables you to create immersive Web contents using the modern Web technologies (HTML5, CSS3, TypeScript) and seamlessly integrate them into mainstream 3D engines like Unity, UnrealEngine, and RealityKit.

## Key Features

- *3D-First Design* - Mix-rendering multiple Web 2D and 3D contents in a single scene.
- *Web Standards Compliant* - Supports WebXR, WebGL, DOM, CSSOM, and other modern Web standards.
- *High Performance* - A builtin ECS to achieve the GPU-driven renderer for elements.
- *TypeScript-Native Scripting* - Ability to write TypeScript instead of JavaScript without extra bundlers or transpilers, JavaScript is also supported.

## Objectives

- Introduce a new way to render the Web contents.
- Designed for Web developers, no need to learn new languages or frameworks.
- Ability to render existing Web applications spatially without any modification.

## Use Cases

By examining various use cases, we aim to help you quickly determine if JSAR is suitable for your needs.

If you are a YodaOS-Master developer, consider using JSAR if any of the following apply to you:

- You want to create desktop widgets like pets, globes, or stock information.
- You want to develop scenes that combine 2D and 3D elements, such as map assistants or product displays.
- You have experiences in web development and love it.

However, you should not choose JSAR if your goals are:

- Developing standalone spatial applications.
- Creating a large-scale game or application.
- Providing a closed-off user experience.
