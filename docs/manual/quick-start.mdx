# Quick Start

To get started with JSAR, you need an XR device or application that integrates this library, because JSAR is just like [Chromium][], it needs a host application to build and run. The followings are the table of supported devices:

| Device | Status |
| ------ | ------ |
| macOS Simulator     | Ok |
| [Rokid AR Studio][] | Ok |
| [Rokid AR Lite][]   | Ok |

To help developers quickly get started with JSAR, we also provided an application **Play WebXR** that integrates JSAR to run Web contents, images, and GLTF models. You can install it via the corresponding application store on your device:

| Device | Status |
| ------ | ------ |
| [Rokid AR Studio][] | Ok |
| [Rokid AR Lite][]   | Ok |
| Quest 4             | Coming Soon |
| Quest 3s            | Coming Soon |
| Pico Neo 3          | Coming Soon |

After you have installed the application on device, you can input a URL to run just like what you do in a classic browser.

In this section, we will introduce how to use _Play WebXR_ and how to start developing the 3D Web application using the Web technologies. If you are a Web developer but not familiar with 3D, it's recommended to learn from this section.
